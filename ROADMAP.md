# Droplr CLI Roadmap

This roadmap outlines potential features and enhancements for the `drplr` CLI tool based on the full capabilities of the [Droplr JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Droplr/droplr-js).

## Current CLI Features ‚úÖ

### Core Upload & Drop Features
- File uploads (public/private with password protection)
- Link drops (URL shortening with title support)
- Note drops (text notes, file-based notes, code snippets with syntax highlighting)
- Custom titles for all drop types
- Privacy controls (public/private) with password protection
- Language detection for code snippets (25+ supported languages)

### Authentication & Configuration
- JWT token authentication (extracted from browser)
- Username/password authentication
- Encrypted credential storage with machine-specific keys
- Auth command with config alias for backwards compatibility

### Command Interface & UX
- Comprehensive help system with examples
- Global command flags (--porcelain, --debug)
- Advanced argument parsing with flag validation
- Detailed error handling with field-specific validation messages
- Modular command architecture (upload, link, note, auth)

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive test suite with Jest (49 passing tests)
- Argument parser tests, command tests, and integration tests
- Multiple test script variants (unit, integration, coverage)
- Complete documentation (TESTING.md, README.md, ROADMAP.md)
- DRY code architecture with centralized utilities

### Enhanced Upload Features üöÄ

#### Advanced Upload Options
- `drplr upload *.png` - Batch upload with glob patterns
- `drplr upload folder/` - Upload entire directories
- `drplr upload --tag "project,assets"` - Tag uploads

- Resume interrupted uploads
- Parallel uploads for multiple files

### Configuration and Profiles ‚öôÔ∏è

#### Multiple Profiles
- `drplr profile create work` - Create named profiles
- `drplr profile use work` - Switch between profiles
- `drplr --profile work upload file.png` - Use specific profile for command

#### Advanced Configuration
- `drplr config show` - Display current configuration
- `drplr config set default-privacy private` - Set defaults
- `drplr config set upload-directory ~/uploads` - Default upload paths

### Output and Integration üîó

#### Output Formats
- `drplr list --json` - JSON output for scripting
- `drplr list --csv` - CSV export
- `drplr upload image.png --copy` - Auto-copy URL to clipboard
- `drplr upload --qr` - Generate QR code for URL

#### Shell Integration
- Bash/Zsh completion for commands and options
- Shell aliases and shortcuts
- Integration with file managers (drag & drop handlers)

### Monitoring and Maintenance üìä

#### Health and Diagnostics
- `drplr doctor` - Check configuration and connectivity
- `drplr quota` - Show storage usage and limits
- `drplr cleanup` - Remove orphaned/expired drops

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture ‚úÖ 
- ‚úÖ Modular structure with separate modules for each feature area (commands/, lib/)
- ‚úÖ Extended authentication system works across all new features  
- ‚úÖ Consistent error handling and user experience patterns
- ‚úÖ DRY principles implemented with centralized argument parsing and utilities

### Dependencies ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Leveraging existing `droplr-api` SDK for all operations
- ‚úÖ Minimal additional dependencies (only Jest for testing)
- ‚úÖ Node.js 14+ compatibility maintained

### User Experience ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Consistent command structure and naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Helpful error messages with field-specific validation details
- ‚úÖ Progressive disclosure (basic ‚Üí advanced features)
- ‚úÖ Full backward compatibility with existing commands

## Community and Contribution

### Open Source Considerations ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Well-documented API for contributors (TESTING.md, inline docs)
- Clear contribution guidelines (established patterns)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (49 passing tests with Jest)
- ‚úÖ Semantic versioning for releases

This roadmap represents the full potential of the Droplr CLI tool. Features will be implemented based on user demand, community feedback, and development resources.
