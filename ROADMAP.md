This roadmap outlines potential features and enhancements for the `drplr` CLI tool based on the full capabilities of the [Droplr JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/Droplr/droplr-js).

## Current CLI Features ‚úÖ

### Core Upload & Drop Features
- File uploads (public/private with password protection)
- Link drops (URL shortening with title support)
- Note drops (text notes, file-based notes, code snippets with syntax highlighting)
- Custom titles for all drop types
- Privacy controls (public/private) with password protection
- Language detection for code snippets (25+ supported languages)

### Authentication & Configuration
