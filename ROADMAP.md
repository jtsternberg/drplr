## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Maintain modular structure with separate modules for each feature area
- Extend existing authentication system for all new features
- Consistent error handling and user experience patterns
- Keep DRY as much as possible.

### Dependencies
- Leverage existing `droplr-api` SDK for all operations
- Minimize additional dependencies
- Maintain Node.js compatibility

### User Experience
- Consistent command structure and naming conventions
- Helpful error messages and suggestions
- Progressive disclosure (basic → advanced features)
- Backward compatibility with existing commands

## Community and Contribution

### Open Source Considerations
- Well-documented API for contributors
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Comprehensive test suite
- Semantic versioning for releases

This roadmap represents the full potential of the Droplr CLI tool. Features will be implemented based on user demand, community feedback, and development resources.
